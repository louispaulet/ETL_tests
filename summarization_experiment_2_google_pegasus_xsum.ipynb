        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the process of summarizing text using the Google PEGASUS-XSUM model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The PEGASUS-XSUM model is a pre-trained abstractive text summarization model that can generate concise summaries of long text inputs.\n",

        "The notebook is organized as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Installation and Importing Libraries**: We install the required Hugging Face Transformers library and the Newspaper3k library for extracting article content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Fetching Article Content**: We use the Newspaper3k library to fetch a long text from a Wikipedia article.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Checking GPU Availability**: We check for the availability of a GPU to run the PEGASUS-XSUM model more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Splitting Text into Chunks**: Since the PEGASUS-XSUM model accepts a maximum of 1024 tokens as input, we split the text into smaller chunks to avoid exceeding this limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Summarizing Text**: We summarize each chunk of text using the PEGASUS-XSUM model and then concatenate the summaries to produce the final summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Evaluating the Summary**: We evaluate the quality of the summary by calculating various evaluation metrics like BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this notebook, you will learn how to fetch content from a Wikipedia article, split the text into smaller chunks, use the PEGASUS-XSUM model to generate summaries, and evaluate the quality of the generated summaries.\n",

            "Nicolas Sarkozy is the sixth president of the French Fifth Republic, and the first conservative president of the republic since the quinquennat reform of 2000, which abolished the two-term limit for presidential elections and replaced it with a five-year term. Nicolas Sarkozy became the first French president since the Fifth Republic to be elected with a majority of votes in the first round of the presidential elections in May 2007 and a majority of votes in the second round of the elections in June 2008.[2] He became the first French president since the Fifth Republic to be elected with a majority of votes in the first round of the presidential elections in May 2007 and a majority of votes in the second round of the elections in June 2008. Nicolas Sarkozy was the French president between 2007 and 2012, during which time the French economy was hit by the global financial crisis and the country's credit rating was cut from AA to A by the ratings agency Standard & Poor's (S&P). President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, left Paris on 14 May for a week-long holiday in the Mediterranean, which included a visit to the island of Gozo, where Sarkozy's father, Pal Sarkozy, is from. Nicolas Sarkozy was sworn in as France's new president on 17 May at the lysée Palace in Paris, the first right-wing leader to occupy the Elysee Palace since the end of the Nazi occupation in World War Two.
